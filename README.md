Tic Tac Toe Project Description
I developed a comprehensive Tic Tac Toe game that extends beyond basic gameplay to include advanced features for an enriched user experience. This project not only offers the classic Tic Tac Toe mechanics but also incorporates functionality to save and track player data.

Key Features:

Basic Game Mechanics: The game adheres to the traditional rules of Tic Tac Toe, allowing two players to compete by taking turns to mark spaces in a 3x3 grid.
Player Data Management: Players' names are saved in a text file, providing a personalized experience. Each game session records the names of the participants.
Score Tracking: The game records players' scores, maintaining a running tally of wins, losses, and draws for each player. This allows players to track their performance over multiple sessions.
Historical Records: Previous game records are stored, enabling players to review past matches. This feature adds a competitive element by allowing players to see their improvement and strategize for future games.
The project leverages file handling techniques to manage player data efficiently. By saving data in a text file, the game ensures that information is retained between sessions, providing a seamless experience for returning players.
